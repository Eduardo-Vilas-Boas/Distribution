Debug.ReloadFieldBegin(DUEL_ATTACK_FIRST_TURN+DUEL_SIMPLE_AI,4) --Begin loading the field for a puzzle, with DUEL_ constants in (int flag) under Master Rule (int rule). 
--The most used constants for puzzles are attack first turn (so you can attack) and simple AI (so the puzzle has some AI)
--List of constants:
--DUEL_TEST_MODE - The player controls the AI. Use for testing, not for challenge puzzles.
--DUEL_ATTACK_FIRST_TURN - Allows the player to attack. Essential for one-turn challenge puzzles.
--DUEL_NO_CHAIN_HINT - Irrelevant for challenge puzzles.
--DUEL_OBSOLETE_RULING - First turn draw and "ignition priority". Irrelevant for challenge puzzles.
--DUEL_PSEUDO_SHUFFLE - Don't shuffle deck. Depending on your puzzle, this may be necessary, or you may not want it.
--DUEL_TAG_MODE - Tag duel. Irrelevant for one-turn challenge puzzles.
--DUEL_SIMPLE_AI - AI player will always activate or summon cards whenever possible, without thinking about strategy. Can be useful in puzzles with care.
--SPEED_DUEL - Speed duel format, 3 zones instead of 5.
