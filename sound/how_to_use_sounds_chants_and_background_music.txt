Background music is played in certain moments while you have the client open.
You can disable it in "Settings", in the "Enable Music" option
The file formats supported here are `.wav`, `.ogg`, `.mp3` and `.flac`.

To change your background music
	1 - Go to your "/sounds/BGM/" folder (if you don't have a "BGM" folder, create it)
	2 - Add any number of files to the following folders (if you don't have those folders, you can create them).
				advantage    : music played when you have an LP advantage over your opponent.
				deck         : music played while you are in the "Deck Edit" menu.
				disadvantage : music played when you have an LP disadvantage compared to your opponent.

				lose         : music played when you lose the duel, until leaving that room.
				menu         : music played in the other game menus, like the home screen.
				win          : music played when you lose the duel, until leaving that room.
	3 If you have more than 1 file in each folder the music that will be played is selected randomly from those files. The file names do not matter.


=============================3-CHANTS====================================

Chants are sound effects played when a certain monster is summoned. To add a chant:
	1 - Go to your "/sounds/chants/" folder (if you don't have a "chants" folder, create it)
	2 - Add the sound file for your chant here. Only `.wav` format is supported
	3 - Rename the file to match the ID/passcode of the monster that will use it.
		An example: Lunalight Leo Dancer's ID is 24550676. To have a chant for its summon you will need a file named `24550676.wav`
	The chants are applied when that monster is summoned in a duel or in a puzzle, after the client is restarted.
