* `@string`
	returns all cards that belong to the `string`  archetype.
	Example: `@Hero`
* `$string`
	returns all cards that have `string` in their name only, which ignores the card text.
	Example: `$Heroic`
* `string1||string2`
	returns all cards that have `string1` OR `string2` in their name/text.
	Example: `Trickstar||Bounzer`
* `!!string`:

* `string1*string2`
	replaces any character in any amount. Example: `Eyes*Dragon` will return cards Blue-Eyes White Dragon, Red-Eyes B. Dragon, Galaxy-Eyes Photon Dragon, etc.

These can be combined functions. Example: `@blue-eyes||$eyes of blue` returns all cards that belong to either the `Blue-Eyes` archetype or have `Eyes of Blue` in their names.

## Customization

**antialias:** set in the `system.conf` file, specifies if the device should use fullscreen anti aliasing.
Makes sharp/pixelated edges softer, but requires more performance.
Also, 2D elements might look blurred with this switched on. Rendering results depend on the hardware available, and the program might look different on different hardware with this
The value is the maximal antialiasing factor requested for the device. The creation method will automatically try smaller values if no window can be created with the given value.
Default value: 0 - disabled.

Change up your **textures**, **sounds** and/or **skin** folder!

### Background and other visual elements:
See README in `textures`.

### Skins:
Editable by adding subfolders to **skin**. For each folder, provide a unique `skin.xml` file, with the changes you want.
You can switch skins in the settings (CTRL+O). For instructions on the supported fields and what they change, see README in `skin`.

### Audio:
See README in `sound`.

	* Uses custom WindBot Ignite.
	* 27 AI decks.
	* Bots incompatible with the Master Rule used in the room are not displayed.
	* Decks used by Windbot do not necessarily match the current banlist: they follow the OCG banlist available when they were implemented.
		* To avoid warning regarding banned cards, the "Don't Check the Deck" option is suggested.
	* To duel the bot: LAN + AI ->  Host -> OK -> Local AI -> Add AI Player
	* List of decks Windbot has access to:
		* Altergeist

	* Known bugs:
		* The AI is not smart, misplaying a lot, which include but is not limited to negating its own monsters, targetting the same cards with removal effects, attacking monsters with higher ATK, etc.
		* Some actions that require selection, like Advanced Ritual Art, might cause the AI to hang on forever.

* Added a basic hand test mode accessible in deck edit, in the `Test Hand` button, to play out a combo via a puzzle.

	* While you are using this mode, the duel never ends, not even by reducing the opponent's LP to 0.

* Replaced old replay recording system:
	* current system is now unaffected by script changes from when the replay was recorded to when it is played.
	* kept compatibility with the old replay system.
		* old replay mode plays the replay while running the scripts. Use this if you are debugging a card.
	* replays are still subjected to changes in the database entry for a card: if the ID/passcode of a card in the played replay was changed, the replay will still be played without errors, but no description and details for that card will be displayed. If you don't have a picture with that old ID/passcode, it will not be displayed.

* Added the option to export the decks used in a replay.
	* decks will be stored in the default deck folder and will be named after the players in the replay.
